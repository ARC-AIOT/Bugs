In correct situation, you should see the following string
in your terminal if you setup baud rate correctly:
"QQ"
"This is Lab1_UART"

If you remove the code
printf("QQ\n");
In src/main.c ,line 27
Prog should show "This is Lab1_UART" instead.

But you'll found that there will show Nothing after you remove 
printf("QQ\n");
